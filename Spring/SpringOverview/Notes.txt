Spring is a framework for java, like Node.js but for java.

How does spring we app work
1. Client sends a Get request to the Spring web server/ application
2. The server sends a data request to the data store to retrieve information.
3. the data store send the requested data back
4. the server sends the back to the user by displaying it in browser.


we can make get requests using curl
curl is short for client for urls

for post requests we can submit an html form.
we can also make post requests with curl
curl -X POST -d "{\"name\":\"Charlie\", \"breed\":\"German Shepherd\"}" -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://www.mypetclinic.com/dogs/ 
-X post tells server client is making a post request
-d short for --data indicates to the server the client is sending new data
"{}" holds the content
-H "Content -Type: application/json" specifies that the data is in json format
finally the location of this request in url form
